Configuring Test Suites
=======================

We already talked about configuring multiple contexts for a single test
suite in a :doc:`previous chapter </user_guide/context>`. Now it is
time to talk about test suites themselves. A test suite represents a group of
concrete features together with the information on how to test them.

With suites you can configure Behat to test different kinds of features
using different kinds of contexts and doing so in one run. Test suites are
really powerful and ``behat.yml`` makes them that much more powerful:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\AdminContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\CoreDomainContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\UserContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Config\Filter\RoleFilter;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('core_features')
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/core')
                ->withContexts(CoreDomainContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('user_features')
                ->withFilter(new RoleFilter('user'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/web')
                ->withContexts(UserContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('admin_features')
                ->withFilter(new RoleFilter('admin'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/web')
                ->withContexts(AdminContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

.. note::

    On PHP < 8.4, you need to wrap new invocations with parentheses before calling config object methods.

    .. code-block:: php

        // ...
        // $profile = new Profile('default')
        $profile = (new Profile('default'))
            ->withSuite(
                // new Suite('core_features')
                (new Suite('core_features'))
                    ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/core')
                    ->withContexts(CoreDomainContext::class)
            )
        // ...

Suite Paths
-----------

One of the most obvious settings of the suites is the ``paths``
configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('core_features')
                ->withPaths(
                    '%paths.base%/features',
                    '%paths.base%/test/features',
                    '%paths.base%/vendor/.../features',
                )
        )
    ;

    return (new Config())
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

As you might imagine, this option tells Behat where to search for test features.
You could, for example, tell Behat to look into the
``features/web`` folder for features and test them with ``WebContext``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\WebContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('web_features')
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/web')
                ->withContexts(WebContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

You then might want to also describe some API-specific features in
``features/api`` and test them with an API-specific ``ApiContext``. Easy:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\ApiContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\WebContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('web_features')
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/web')
                ->withContexts(WebContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('api_features')
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features/api')
                ->withContexts(ApiContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

This will cause Behat to:

#. Find all features inside ``features/web`` and test them using your
   ``WebContext``.

#. Find all features inside ``features/api`` and test them using your
   ``ApiContext``.

.. note::

    ``%paths.base%`` is a special variable in ``behat.yml`` that refers
    to the folder in which ``behat.yml`` is stored. When using it, or
    any other percent-encased variable, it has to be put in quotes.

Path-based suites are an easy way to test highly-modular applications
where features are delivered by highly decoupled components. With suites
you can test all of them together.

Suite Filters
-------------

In addition to being able to run features from different directories,
we can run scenarios from the same directory, but filtered by specific
criteria. The Gherkin parser comes bundled with a set of cool filters
such as *tags* and *name* filters. You can use these filters to run
features with specific tag (or name) in specific contexts:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\ApiContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\WebContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Filter\TagFilter;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('web_features')
                ->withFilter(new TagFilter('@web'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(WebContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('api_features')
                ->withFilter(new TagFilter('@api'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(ApiContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

This configuration will tell Behat to run features and scenarios
tagged as ``@web`` in ``WebContext`` and features and scenarios
tagged as ``@api`` in ``ApiContext``. Even if they all are stored
in the same folder. How cool is that? But it gets even better,
because Gherkin 4+ (used in Behat 3+) added a very special *role*
filter. That means, you can now have nice actor-based suites:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\AdminContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\UserContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Filter\RoleFilter;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('user_features')
                ->withFilter(new RoleFilter('user'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(UserContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('api_features')
                ->withFilter(new RoleFilter('admin'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(AdminContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return (new Config())
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

A Role filter takes a look into the feature description block:

.. code-block:: gherkin

    Feature: Registering users
      In order to help more people use our system
      As an admin
      I need to be able to register more users

It looks for a ``As a ...`` or ``As an ...`` pattern and guesses its
actor from it. It then filters features that do not have the expected
actor from the set. In the case of our example, it basically means that
features described from the perspective of the *user* actor will
be tested in ``UserContext`` and features described from the
perspective of the *admin* actor will be tested in ``AdminContext``.
Even if they are in the same folder.

While it is possible to specify filters as part of suite configuration,
sometimes you will want to exclude certain scenarios across the suite, with the
option to override the filters at the command line.

This is achieved by specifying the filter in the gherkin configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Filter\TagFilter;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withFilter(new TagFilter('~@wip'))
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

In this instance, scenarios tagged as @wip will be ignored unless the CLI
command is run with a custom filter, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    vendor/bin/behat --tags=wip

   More details on identifying tests can be found in the chapter
   :doc:`/user_guide/command_line_tool/identifying`.

Suite Contexts
--------------

Being able to specify a set of features with a set of contexts for
these features inside the suite has a very interesting side-effect.
You can specify the same features in two different suites being tested
against different contexts *or* the same contexts configured differently.
This basically means that you can use the same subset of features to
develop different layers of your application with Behat:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // behat.php

    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\DomainContext;
    use App\Tests\Behat\Context\WebContext;
    use Behat\Config\Config;
    use Behat\Config\Filter\TagFilter;
    use Behat\Config\Profile;
    use Behat\Config\Suite;

    $profile = new Profile('default')
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('domain_features')
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(DomainContext::class)
        )
        ->withSuite(
            new Suite('web_features')
                ->withFilter(new TagFilter('@web'))
                ->withPaths('%paths.base%/features')
                ->withContexts(WebContext::class)
        )
    ;

    return new Config()
        ->withProfile($profile)
    ;

In this case, Behat will first run all the features from the ``features/``
folder in ``DomainContext`` and then only those tagged with ``@web`` in
``WebContext``.

   It might be worth reading how to :ref:`execute a specific
   suite<user-guide--command-line-tool--identifying-tests--by-suite>` or
   :ref:`initialize a new
   suite<user-guide--initialize-a-new-behat-project--suite-initialisation>`
